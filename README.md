# Tetris Solver

A Tetris line-clearing solver built with Flask and an adaptive beam search algorithm. Given a starting board and a fixed sequence of pieces, it finds the exact moves needed to clear a target number of lines — and visualises them step by step.

## Hosting It Live for Free

The best free option is **[Render](https://render.com)**. It supports Python/Flask natively, requires zero configuration files beyond what is already in this repo, keeps your app alive on free tier (with some cold-start delay), and has a straightforward deploy flow from GitHub.

### Step 1 — Push to GitHub

If you have not already, create a repository on GitHub and push this project to it.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

Make sure `.gitignore` includes at minimum:

```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
tetris_solver.db
winnable_games.csv
log.txt
```

### Step 2 — Add a `Procfile`

Render needs to know how to start the app. Create a file called `Procfile` (no extension) in the root of the repo:

```
web: gunicorn app:app
```

`gunicorn` is already in `requirements.txt`. Do not use `python app.py` in production — Flask's built-in server is not designed to handle real traffic.

### Step 3 — Deploy on Render

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up with your GitHub account.
2. Click **New → Web Service**.
3. Select your repository from the list.
4. Render will auto-detect Python. Fill in the fields:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | anything you like |
| **Region** | closest to you |
| **Branch** | `main` |
| **Runtime** | `Python 3` |
| **Build Command** | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| **Start Command** | `gunicorn app:app` |
| **Instance Type** | `Free` |

5. Click **Deploy Web Service**.
6. Wait ~2 minutes for the first build. Your app will be live at `https://YOUR-APP-NAME.onrender.com`.

### Important: The Simulation tab on free tier

The simulation runs games in parallel using `multiprocessing.Pool`. On Render's free tier (shared CPU, 512 MB RAM) this will work for small runs (≤ 100 games) but may be slow or time out for large ones (1000 games). Single-game solving works fine.

If you hit timeouts, add this environment variable in the Render dashboard under **Environment**:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `WEB_CONCURRENCY` | `1` |

This tells gunicorn to use a single worker, which reduces memory pressure and plays more nicely with multiprocessing on constrained hardware.

## Running Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

To enable debug mode (auto-reload on code changes):

```bash
FLASK_DEBUG=true python app.py
```

## Algorithm Overview

The solver uses **adaptive beam search** with a progressive width schedule `(1 → 5 → 20 → 100)`. It tries the narrowest beam first (fast, greedy) and only widens the search if the solution is not found. Most games are solved at width 1 or 5, making the average cost ~620 board evaluations per game versus ~70,000 for a fixed wide beam.

Board states are scored on four factors: lines cleared (dominant), aggregate height, holes, and bumpiness. See the [How It Works](/how-it-works) page for a full explanation.

## Alternative Free Hosting Options

| Platform | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Render** | Recommended. Native Python, easy GitHub deploy, free tier keeps app alive. |
| **Railway** | Similar to Render, slightly more generous free tier, also easy. Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app). |
| **Fly.io** | More powerful free tier, but requires installing the `flyctl` CLI and a config file. Better for serious projects. |
| **PythonAnywhere** | Free tier for simple Flask apps, but multiprocessing is restricted — the simulation tab will not work on the free plan. |
| **Vercel / Netlify** | Built for JavaScript frontends. Python is supported via serverless functions but multiprocessing will not work. Not recommended for this project. |
